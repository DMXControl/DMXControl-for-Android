/**
 * The <code>OSCListener</code>
 * interface is used to register
 * a client to an <code>OSCReceiver</code>
 * object which will be notified when
 * an incoming message was received.
 * <p/>
 * See <code>OSCReceiver</code> for a code example.
 * <p/>
 * Note that these methods are typically called from the OSC receiver thread
 * which is not the regular AWT event dispatcher thread. You may often want
 * to defer actual code to the event thread. You can do this by adding the
 * received messages to a list and invoking the actual code using
 * <code>EventQueue.invokeLater()</code>. This is particularly required when
 * dealing with GUI processes which require methods to be called in the event
 * thread. A future version of NetUtil may include a utility deferrer class.
