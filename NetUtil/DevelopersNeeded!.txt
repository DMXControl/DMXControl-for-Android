NetUtil needs your help!

unfortunately I don't have enough time to devote to NetUtil anymore. During
the course of 2006 and 2007, I need to turn all of my software projects
into multiple-developers projects to gain resources for new projects.

I'm looking for people who are willing to help and co-develop NetUtil.

Minimum skills of developers:
- good experience in java programming

Optimum skills of developers:
- interest in supercollider
- interest in developing applications on top of netuil

What i offer:
- help with all programming questions
- help with understanding my style of programming
- help with setting up development mailing lists and resources
- help to move the project to a cross-platform IDE (e.g. Eclipse)

Suggested next development steps:
- creation of custom message encoders and decoders
  that support different kinds of type tags and charsets
- extending the OSCClient and OSCServer classes to control
  connection opening and closing
- making OSCClient and OSCServer robust against channel closing
